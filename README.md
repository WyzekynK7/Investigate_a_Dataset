# Investigate a Dataset
## Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) by King Solomon Otoo

## Project Overview

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib` to make your analysis easier.

Prepare for this project with: [Intro to Data Analysis](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud170-nd)

## Why this Project?

In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What will I learn?

After completing the project, you will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in `NumPy` and `Pandas` to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use `Matplotlib` to produce plots showing your findings

## Introduction

For the project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use `Pandas` and `NumPy` to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.

### Choose Your Data Set

**Dataset Description**:
The data contions census that counted every person living in the United States and the five U.S. territories.
The variables includes Age, Work class, Final weight(fnlwgt), Education, Education number, Marital status, Occupation, 
Relationship, Race, Sex, Cpital gains, Capital loss, Hours per week, Native country and Income. 

### Get Organized

Jupyter notebook was used for the analysis and the analysis is orgainsed in:
* Data Wrangling -- Accessing the data for issues such missiing values, duplicates in the dataset adn Cleaning the data by fixing this issues.
* Exploratory Data Analysis -- Exploring various variable using chart andd also computing statistics.
* Conclusion -- Drawing conclusion from the findings.

### Analyze Your Data

Questions Posed:
* Are males more than females in the census?
* between male and females who has the highest avg hours per weak?
* what is the education certifcate attained by most people?
* do higher education nuber implies hours per weak?

### Share Your Findings

Findings
* The Data analysis showed that men were 28999 and females 10444 which is claerly seen in the chart that men are more than females.
* The analysis also indicates men has the highest average hours oer week.
* The Education qualification attained most is HS-grad. 
* There is no relationship between educarion and hours per week thus higher education number does indicate a smaller hours per week.
